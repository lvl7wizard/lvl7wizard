# Hey, I'm Dave 👋 

* 🎓 I recently graduated from a 3 month Software Development bootcamp where I focussed on building fullstack web and mobile apps using Javascript and React.
* 🌱 I'm currently learning TypeScript and exploring different frontend libraries (bootstrap, styled-components, CSS modules).
